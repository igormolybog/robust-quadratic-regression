## Conic Optimization for Robust Quadratic Regression: Deterministic Bounds and Statistical Analysis

Main scripts:
- State_Estimation_sdp.m    :     multi-round SDP simulation (5 sims for each data points)
- State_Estimation_socp.m   :     multi-round SOCP simulation (5 sims for each data points)

Variables:
- result    :   the RMSE estimation error
- resres    :   collects all RMSE values whose average were plotted
